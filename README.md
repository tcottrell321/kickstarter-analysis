# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Purpose of the Analysis
Our Client, Louise, wants to create a Kickstarter Campaign to fund her new US Based Theatre Play. In order to ensure sucess with this campaign, she requested an analysis of past Kickstarter Campaigns to determine if there were any trends leading to success. Using data from over 4000 campaigns, the data was filtered, sorted, and statistically analyzed for any findings that might be useful to Louise. We first present our Final Conclusions, then the supporting data and graphs upon which our final conclusions were based.

## Final Conclusions
1. To be successful, individual Theatre Play Campaigns should not exceed $2000. Louise's Proposed Campaign of $20,000 exceeded that threshold significantly, therefore has little chance of success unless the target is lowered. 
2. Seasonality affected the success of Theatre Play Campaigns and are best launched in May of each year. 
3. Theatre Play Campaigns in Great Britian had a higher success rate when adhering to the limit, therefore, Lousie might consider running her play and Campaign in Great Britain if she has that flexibility.
